# Protoc.exe

Precompiled Windows binary for the Google Protocol Buffer Compiler. This has
been built using Visual Studio 2013, with the runtime libraries statically
linked so there will not be dependencies on installed versions of DLLs. If
you have problems running protoc.exe on Windows, this executable should fix it.
